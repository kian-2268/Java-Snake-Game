# Java-Snake-Game
Simple Java Snake Game. Uses JFrame as the main window and switches between two panels, the game panel and the menu panel. When the player click the "start game" button it switches from menu panel to game panel and also they keyboard input is focused on the game.
This snake game code is originally from bro code https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ but I wanted to improve this further by slowly adding obstacle or more feature in the game.
